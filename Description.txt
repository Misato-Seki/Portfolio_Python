The third exercise in the chapter continues with the calculator exercises done earlier. 
This time the idea is to finally take out the annoying problems with numbers, input validity and the stability problems caused by type conversion funvtion.


Make the following changes to the calculator: 
Every time the user gives numbers to the program, the system asks for the numbers with the prompt "Give a number: " and continues until a valid number is given. 
If the number is not correct, the system gives an error message "This input is invalid."
